<p>This is a site for you (yes, you!) to connect with other humans for romance, socializing, recreation, and/or sex, regardless of your gender or lack thereof.
  It is also a place for everyone to treat each other as full human beings with all the complexities that go with that.
  You for them and them for you.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’ve got a few guidelines to follow while you’re here:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg">
    <h3>Respect for femininity</h3>

    <p>This site makes no effort to draw a line around the category of “woman”,
        but anyone who feels that a part of themselves is feminine deserves to have that part be respected.</p>

    <h3>Respect for people of color</h3>

    <p>Non-white folks deserve online spaces where they are treated like their complete selves, not just members of their race.
      This should be such a space.
      To the extent your sexuality involves a racial component, express the desires not the aversions.</p>

    <h3>Consent is an ongoing process</h3>

    <p>Boundaries can exist at any point on any level. Be prepared to acknowledge and respect them.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg">
    <h3>Respect for genders and sexualities outside the ones you currently understand</h3>

    <p>It’s a special kind of insult to tell someone that something they've struggled to understand about themselves is invalid.</p>

    <h3>Accept people’s bodies as they are</h3>

    <p>No one’s body is wrong, only the mistreatment of them because of their body.
      This includes secondary sexual characteristics, primary sexual characteristics, weight, age, ableness, &c.</p>

    <h3>No threats of violence</h3>

    <p>Unless you're engaging in a mutually-sought-after BDSM style thing, violent speech has no place here.
        If someone doesn't understand that you are joking, you’re in the wrong, not them.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg">
    <h3>Be human</h3>

    <p>No robots, monsters, catfish, energy vampires, or trolls.</p>
